# Day 2 Notes
## July 30, 2025

##### 1. Make a new repo on GitHub website
##### 2. Add this repo to personal computer using git clone

```git clone <repository_url>```

##### 3. Make a new README file.  Lots of options.  The command favoured by the instructor was “code README”, which opened up a file in VS Code.

```code README ```

##### Edit file as you see fit.  Then save.

##### 4. Stage the file using git add

``` git add README ```

##### 5. Commit the file

``` git commit README ```

##### 6. Create a remote

``` git remote add origin <url> ```

##### It seems this step can be skipped if we have already created a remote and simply want to add a new file to it…?

##### 7. Push the file to GitHub

``` git push -u origin main ```

##### where “origin” is the remote and “main” is the branch.
